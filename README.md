##  What I’m up to  
- Building data-driven, ML-powered applications  
- Exploring full-stack development (React, Node.js, FastAPI…)  
- Deploying scalable solutions with Docker, Kubernetes, and Cloud platforms (GCP, Firebase, Heroku…)  
- Blending my passion for code and design—thanks to Figma and Canva!

## Showcasing Projects

### **Sentiment Analysis with Streamlit**  
An interactive NLP app that lets users upload text (or paste tweets) and instantly visualize sentiment—positive, neutral, or negative. Powered by scikit-learn/PyTorch for real-time predictions!

### **CLI YouTube Video Summarizer**  
A sleek command-line tool written in Python: download YouTube videos, run them through an ML summarizer, and extract bullet‑point recaps. Perfect for devs on-the-go who want the essence without watching the full video.

### **TaxiService Full‑Stack App**  
A JavaScript-based full‑stack demo: users can book rides, real-time updates on trip status, and integrated maps. A solid hands-on project for showcasing React, Node.js and WebSocket interactions.

*(Other notable mentions: my “FL” data‑analysis Jupyter notebook, and a sleek personal portfolio site powered by React, check my GitHub for more!)*
